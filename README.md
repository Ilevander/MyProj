This code uses a dictionary (monthsanddays) to store the month names as keys and the number of days in each month as values. The user is prompted to enter a month, and the entry is converted to lowercase to handle case.

Then the program checks if the month entered by the user exists in the dictionary. If so, it retrieves the number of days associated with the month and displays it. If the month is not found in the dictionary, the program displays an error message.
